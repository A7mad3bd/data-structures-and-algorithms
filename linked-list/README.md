# Singly Linked List
It's a list Like arrays, but Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays,
linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location,
the elements are linked using pointers.
## Challenge
The challenge asked to create a linked list and create 3 methods to insert nodes and check the value if includes in the list and another method called toString to print list in a special template
## Approach & Efficiency
The time complexity for the 3 methods is O(n) space O(1)     (linear)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert ->to insert nodes at first of the list
includes -> to check the value if includes in the list 
toString -> to print list in special template
