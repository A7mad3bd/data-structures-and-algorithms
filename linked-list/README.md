## Approach & Efficiency

  The Big O for time O(n) counting up linear and the space is O(n) .

## Solution





# Challenge Summary
Write a function Zip two linked list into new linked list by adding node fron every list 
## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

An approach is based on the length of tow lists index and when counter both of them will be at the end (null) zip_list it is complete.  The Big O for time O(n) counting up linear and the space is O(1) .

## Solution

# Challenge Summary
This challenge has three functions for linked list:

append: Adds a new node with value at the end of the list.

Insert before: Add new node with value before specific node .

Insert after: Add new node with value after specific node .

## Approach & Efficiency

all of them at the worst case will be O(n)
and maybe will be just O(1)

# Singly Linked List
It's a list Like arrays, but Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays,
linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location,
the elements are linked using pointers.
## Challenge
The challenge asked to create a linked list and create 3 methods to insert nodes and check the value if includes in the list and another method called toString to print list in a special template
## Approach & Efficiency
The time complexity for the 3 methods is O(n) space O(1)     (linear)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert ->to insert nodes at first of the list
includes -> to check the value if includes in the list 
toString -> to print list in special template
