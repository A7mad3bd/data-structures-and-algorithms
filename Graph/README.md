# Graphs

- A graph is a non-linear data structure that is used to store data in the form of
- Vertices(Nodes) and Edges(connections) between those Vertices.

## Challenge

- Implement your own Graph.
- The graph should be represented as an adjacency list,
  and should include the following methods:
- add node
- add edge
- get nodes
- get neighbors
- size

## Approach & Efficiency

- addNode()
    - Time: O(1)
    - Space: O(1)

- addEdge()
    - Time: O(1)
    - Space: O(1)

- getNodes()
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)

- size()
    - Time: O(1)
    - Space: O(1)

- getNeighbors()
   - Time: O(1)
   - Space: O(1)
